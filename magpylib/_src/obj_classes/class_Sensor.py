class Sensor(BaseGeo, BaseDisplayRepr):
    """ Magnetic field sensor.

    Can be used as `observers` input for magnetic field computation.

    When `position=(0,0,0)` and `orientation=None` local object coordinates
    coincide with the gobal coordinate system.

    A sensor is made up of pixel (sensing elements) where the magnetic field is evaluated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position: array_like, shape (3,) or (m,3), default=`(0,0,0)`
        Object position(s) in the global coordinates in units of [mm]. For m>1, the
        `position` and `orientation` attributes together represent an object path.

    pixel: array_like, shape (3,) or (n1,n2,...,3), default=`(0,0,0)`
        Sensor pixel (=sensing elements) positions in the local object coordinates
        (rotate with object), in units of [mm].

    orientation: scipy `Rotation` object with length 1 or m, default=`None`
        Object orientation(s) in the global coordinates. `None` corresponds to
        a unit-rotation. For m>1, the `position` and `orientation` attributes
        together represent an object path.

    style: dict
        Object style inputs must be in dictionary form, e.g. `{'color':'red'}` or
        using style-underscore_magic, e.g. `style_color='red'`.

    Returns
    -------
    observer: `Sensor` object

    Examples
    --------
    `Sensor` objects are observers for magnetic field computation. In this example we compute the
    B-field in units of [mT] as seen by the sensor in the center of a circular current loop:

    >>> import magpylib as magpy
    >>> sens = magpy.Sensor()
    >>> loop = magpy.current.Loop(current=1, diameter=1)
    >>> B = sens.getB(loop)
    >>> print(B)
    [0.         0.         1.25663706]

    We rotate the sensor by 45 degrees and compute the field again:

    >>> sens.rotate_from_rotvec((45,0,0))
    >>> B = sens.getB(loop)
    >>> print(B)
    [0.         0.88857659 0.88857659]

    Finally we set some sensor pixels and compute the field again:

    >>> sens.pixel=((0,0,0), (.1,0,0), (.2,0,0))
    >>> B = sens.getB(loop)
    >>> print(B)
